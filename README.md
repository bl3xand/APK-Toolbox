## About

APK Toolbox started as a way to get a second copy of an app next to the original and grew into a small set of tools for APK files. It follows in the steps of [Obtainium](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium), [SAI](https://github.com/Aefyr/SAI) and [AntiSplit-M](https://github.com/AbdurazaaqMohammed/AntiSplit-M) — what their authors made, brought together in one place, with a few things added:

- **Sources** — track apps from GitHub, GitLab, F-Droid, app stores, Telegram channels and other sites, and install their new versions straight from the source.
- **Cloning** — make a copy of an app under a new package name and app name, take away the permissions it should not have, and keep the clone in step with the original as it gets updated: seamlessly, with its data kept.
- **A clone instead of the app** — a tracked app can be installed as a clone only, without the permissions you switch off, and is updated from its source without the original ever being on the device.
- **SAI** — install split APKs (APKS, XAPK, APKM, ZIP) and export installed apps as `.apks` archives.
- **AntiSplit** — merge an app that ships as several APKs into one regular APK.

One schedule and one installation method serve all of it: what is found in the background is installed the same way whether it is a tracked app or a clone.

Nothing is left behind on disk: a result is either installed or saved where you choose, and temporary files are removed afterwards.

Two things it does that are hard to find elsewhere:

- **Apps from Telegram channels.** A channel that posts builds as files is tracked like a store: new files are found, downloaded and installed, in the background too.
- **A clone instead of the app, kept up to date.** An app can be installed only as a clone with the permissions you take away — no network, no contacts — and every new release is rebuilt the same way and installed over it, with the data kept. The original never has to be on the device.

## Download

Get the latest build from [Releases](https://github.com/bl3xand/APK-Toolbox/releases). `APK-Toolbox-<version>-universal.apk` installs on anything; the others are smaller, one for each kind of processor (`arm64-v8a` for nearly every phone of the last years).

## Requirements

- Android 8.0 or newer. Updating without a prompt through the system installer needs Android 12; before that it takes Shizuku.
- Any processor: the universal APK installs everywhere, and there is a smaller one for each kind.
- No root needed.
- [Shizuku](https://shizuku.rikka.app/) is optional — it lets apps and clones update without any prompts.
- The interface speaks English, Русский, 中文, 日本語, العربية, Deutsch, Français, Español, Português (Brasil), Türkçe, 한국어, Italiano, Polski, Tiếng Việt, Bahasa Indonesia, Українська — pick yours in settings.

## Getting started

Install APK Toolbox and open it. It asks for two things: access to files and permission to install apps. After that the four tabs are ready to use. The **i** button on each tab says what the tab is for.

## Sources — apps straight from where they are published

Add an app by the link to its page — a GitHub or GitLab repository, an F-Droid package, a store page, a Telegram channel, a direct link to an APK — or find it by name in the sources that can be searched (GitHub, GitLab, Codeberg, F-Droid, APKPure, Aptoide, Uptodown, RuStore, Tencent, CoolApk, Apk4Free and a few more). APK Toolbox then knows which version is the latest, shows what is new in it, and installs or updates the app on request or in the background.

- APK Toolbox itself is on the list from the first start, tracked from its GitHub releases, so it keeps itself up to date like everything else. Take it off the list and it stays off.
- Tap an app to see its versions and release notes, to **Update** or **Remove** it.
- Hold an app for everything else: check it now, change its options, give it categories, pin it, share its link, download a release file, or select several apps at once.
- **Filter** narrows the list by state, source and category.
- **More settings** when adding, and **App options** later, hold what a particular app may need: which file of a release to take, how to read its version, whether to update it automatically. Every option says what it does.

Access tokens, the choice of releases, the order of the list and import and export live under **Sources settings**. Lists are stored in the format of [Obtainium](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium), so they can be moved between the two apps in either direction, and `obtainium://` links open in APK Toolbox.

### An app that is installed from somewhere else

When the build on the device is signed by someone else than the one being added — a fork next to the original, say — the new one cannot go over it. APK Toolbox says so on the app's page and tracks nothing yet: the list, and whatever was tracked under that package before, stays as it was. **Delete current** removes the installed build, after which the page is an ordinary install. A different link for a package that is tracked already asks before it replaces the source.

### Telegram channels

Channels that post apps as files can be tracked like any other source: add the link to the channel (`https://t.me/name`), or to a message with the file.

- The files of a channel cannot be read anonymously, so this needs an account: **Sources settings → Telegram → Sign in**, with a phone number or with a QR code scanned from another device. The session stays on the device, encrypted with a key of the Android Keystore, and **Sign out** removes it.
- A channel may post one app or hundreds. What is tracked is one kind of file: the releases that agree in the app's name and in the words that say which build it is (a clone, a beta, an architecture). The version is read from the file's name. A channel with several kinds asks which one to follow, in a list that can be searched; a link to a message says so by itself.
- A file named some other way is not taken for a release of the app. When an author starts naming files differently, the kind to follow can be changed in **App options**.
- Only a small part of a file is fetched to learn what app it is; the whole file is downloaded when it is installed.

## Cloning — a second copy of an app

1. On the **Installed** side pick an app, or tap **Choose APK**.
2. Adjust the package name and the app name. The defaults are `<original>.clone` and "<name> Clone", or the next free number (`.clone2`, "Clone 2", …) if you have cloned the app before.
3. Leave **Mark the icon with a dot** on to tell the clone from the original on the home screen. Each clone gets its own colour. The dot is drawn on top of the app's own icon layers, so it works for apps of any size.
4. **Permissions** lists everything the app asks for; switch off what the clone should not have — the network, the contacts, the location. The clone is built without them, so the system never grants them.
5. **Patches** — optional changes to the clone's code. Every patch is applied only to the clone and can make the app crash; the list is short and each patch says what it does. See [Patches](#patches) below.
6. Tap **Clone**, then **Install** the result or **Save** it.

The clone is a separate app with its own data, installed side by side with the original. An app can be cloned as many times as you like.

### Keeping clones current

The **Clones** side lists every clone you have installed. Tap one to see which app and version it was made from, to **Update** it to the original's current version or to **Delete** it.

- **Updates are seamless.** A new version of the original is cloned again under the same package and signed with the same key, so it installs over the clone like any ordinary update: the data, the sign-ins, the icon mark and the removed permissions all stay.
- **Permissions can be changed at any time.** **Permissions** takes permissions away from a clone, or gives them back, after it was made: the clone is built again and installed over itself, so its data is kept.
- **A removed permission stays removed.** The choice is remembered by name. If a release stops asking for a permission and a later one brings it back, it is taken away again; it stays in the list meanwhile, so it can be allowed again.

**Refresh** looks at every clone and its original again and brings the clones that are behind up to date one after another.

### A clone instead of the app

An app that asks for more than you want to give it — and cannot be denied the network, say — does not have to be installed at all. The page of a tracked app that is not installed has a switch, **Install as a clone**. Switched on, it shows what a clone is always made with — the package, the name, the mark on the icon and **Permissions** — and **Install** does the rest:

- Every release is downloaded, rebuilt as a clone — under the clone's package, without the permissions you switched off — and only the clone is installed. Choosing permissions is optional; nothing is asked on the way.
- The clone is updated from the source like any tracked app, in the background too, and every update is built without the same permissions. The original is never on the device.
- If the publisher's signing key changes between releases, the update is refused the way the system would refuse it for the app itself.

The two tabs then share the clone between them. **Sources** is about where it comes from and its updates; what it is made with is set on the clone's own page in **Clones** — **Clone settings** on the one page and **Show in Sources** on the other lead across. Changing the permissions of an installed clone rebuilds it from itself and the manifest kept from its original, so nothing is downloaded again, and installs it over itself with its data. A release that asks for a permission no earlier one had is listed on the app's page as **New permissions**.

An app that is installed already has **Reinstall as a clone** instead of the switch. A clone is a separate app that starts empty — data and sign-ins do not move over — so this asks first. The clone is built from the app that is on the device, with nothing downloaded, and **Delete the original** says whether that app goes afterwards: it is removed only once the clone is installed, so a "Cancel" in the system's dialog loses nothing. Nothing about the app changes until then: leave the page without installing, and the app stays what it was. **Back to the original** removes the clone, with everything in it, and installs the app as its publisher made it.

### Clones that outlive their original

A clone made from an installed app is rebuilt from that app, so it stops being updated when the original is removed. The **Clones** list says where each clone gets its updates: *From the original*, *From a source*, or *No original*. Google Play hands its files to nobody else, but the same builds are carried by other stores: **Update from a source** on a clone's page looks the app up by its package in APKPure, RuStore, Galaxy Store and others, one after another, and has the clone kept up to date from the first that has it, in the Sources tab. The original can then be removed. A clone of an app you track already is picked up the same way when its switch is turned on. An update signed by someone else than the installed original is refused.

### Staying at a version, and finding things

**Do not update**, at the bottom of a tracked app's page and of a clone's, keeps it at the version it has: nothing offers or installs a newer one, and the list says so next to the version. **Filter** on both tabs picks apps by any of the chosen kinds — with an update, not updated, originals or clones, from the original or from a source — by source and by category; *All* switches every chip of a group on or off. Categories are shared between the tabs; a clone is filed under them by holding its row.

A clone is signed with APK Toolbox's key, not the publisher's: sign-in with Google, payments and integrity checks may not work in it.

## Patches

A patch is a change to the clone's code, made while it is built. The picker lives behind the **Patches** button of a clone draft and of a clone's own page; each patch can be switched on or off at any time, and a change rebuilds the clone over itself, with its data kept. Every patch is applied only to the clone — the original is never touched.

</p>

## Updates in the background

One group of settings covers both tracked apps and clones:

- **Check for updates** — a background check every 4, 6, 8, 12 or 24 hours, or at the established daily-to-yearly intervals, for **Apps from sources**, **Clones** or both. The first eligible run is anchored to a chosen local hour (01:00 by default). WorkManager is inexact: Doze, battery/network constraints and device restrictions can delay a check. It survives reboots. On its own it only notifies. **Check now** runs it at once and reports everything that is waiting.
- **Install automatically** — install what was found without asking. **Wait for Wi-Fi** and **Wait for the charger** hold an update back until the condition is met and then install it by themselves.
- **Installation method**:
  - **Standard** — the system installer. Without a prompt it updates only what APK Toolbox installed itself and what targets a recent Android version. Clones, being re-signed, are additionally held back while Google Play Protect app scanning is on.
  - **Shizuku** — installs with shell privileges, with no prompts, for any app. After a reboot the check waits for Shizuku to be started.

**Check when the app opens** is separate from the schedule: with it on, tracked apps and clones are looked at again every time APK Toolbox is opened.

Whatever could not be updated automatically is reported in a notification. An install you start by hand always goes through the system installer.

Installing through root is available as an experimental switch. It has not been tested on a rooted device.

## SAI — split APKs in, `.apks` out

- **Choose APKS** installs a bundle (APKS, XAPK, APKM, ZIP), several split APK files or a single APK as one app. Pick which splits to include — all of them, or only those this device needs — and optionally re-sign them first. OBB expansion files inside an XAPK are copied to where the app expects them.
- Tap an installed app to **Export** it as an `.apks` archive. The archive carries the icon and metadata in the format [SAI](https://github.com/Aefyr/SAI) defined, so other tools recognise it.

## AntiSplit — merging into one APK

Turns an app that ships as several APKs into a single regular APK.

- Pick an installed split app, tap **Choose split APK files**, or share / open the files into APK Toolbox from another app.
- Choose the splits: all, or only the ABI, screen density and language this device uses.
- **Merge**, then install or save the result as `<name>_antisplit.apk`.

Splits whose version or package differs from the base are refused unless you allow merging them anyway. Apps protected by PairIP are left unsigned, since a re-signed build of such an app would not start.

Merging decodes the app's resource tables in memory, which takes about twenty times their size, and Android caps what an app may use. Apps whose tables come to more than roughly 20 MB are therefore refused with a message rather than merged; those are better merged on a computer with [APKEditor](https://github.com/REAndroid/APKEditor).

## Signing key

Everything APK Toolbox produces has to be signed, and the original signature cannot be kept: it stops matching as soon as the APK is modified. A fresh installation creates a private signing key, encrypted in app-private storage, and keeps it across app restarts and upgrades. The historical built-in key remains available only to recognize/update clones created by older versions. It is shared and public, so it is not used for new builds.

In settings you can **Create** another key or **Import** one from a PKCS#12 (`.p12`, `.pfx`) or BKS keystore. **Export** a password-protected backup and keep it somewhere safe: changing or losing a key prevents in-place clone updates signed with it and may require reinstalling those clones, which can lose their data. The app cannot recover a lost key. Resetting/replacing a key asks for confirmation. No warranty is provided; APK Toolbox remains GPL-3.0 licensed.

Background installs use PackageInstaller's unattended update path only when Android considers the installed clone and installer/update-owner state eligible and the target SDK meets that Android release's threshold. On Android 14 and newer, update ownership is requested only for the first PackageInstaller install of a clone actually built by APK Toolbox, when the platform permission is available. Initial installs, root/Shizuku installs, unsupported or ineligible cases, and rejected unattended sessions retain an interactive fallback. Android policy and device restrictions can always require confirmation; unattended installation is not guaranteed.

### Verification info

Every release APK is signed with the author's key. Verify it before installing — for example with `apksigner verify --print-certs app.apk` — against:

* Package name: `io.github.bl3xand.apkcloner`
* SHA-256 hash of signing certificate:

```
06:95:1F:0B:6F:94:7D:C0:C1:CD:C2:AC:CF:C7:9B:3B:DB:9F:6D:B1:57:6E:23:D7:94:68:EE:25:58:26:6A:4C
```

Clones you build yourself are signed with this installation's private key (or an imported key) — that is a different certificate and a different story, see above.

## Good to know

- A merged APK is signed with a different key than the original from a store, so it cannot be installed over it — the original has to be removed first.
- Google Play Protect treats re-signed apps as unknown and may block them, including installs you start by hand. It may also object to APK Toolbox itself, as an app that installs other apps.
- Cloning changes the manifest and the package name in the resource table, nothing else. Apps that check their own package name or signature, and services bound to them (Google sign-in, Firebase, in-app purchases), may not work in a clone.
- A cloned app made of split APKs is saved as a single `.apks` archive.

## Log

**Settings → Show log** tells what the app did and what failed: checks, downloads, clones, merges, installs, changes of settings. It is kept for 30 days, can be narrowed to a period and to any set of levels, and **Save** writes the whole history to a `.log` file — attach that file to an issue and it says what happened: every step of every build, install and download, with the reasons in the system's own words.

## Building

```bash
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

This makes one APK for each kind of processor and a universal one that has them all, in `app/build/outputs/apk/release/`. A release build is shrunk and obfuscated with R8. It is signed if a `keystore.properties` file (`storeFile`, `storePassword`, `keyAlias`, `keyPassword`) is present in the project root, and left unsigned otherwise.

Telegram channels need the app's own API id and hash from [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org). Copy `telegram.properties.example` to `telegram.properties` and fill them in; the file stays out of git. Without it the app builds and the Telegram source says it is not available.

## Credits

APK Toolbox stands on other people's work. It is not an attempt to replace any of these apps, and it is made with respect for the effort that went into them — the author simply finds it convenient to have everything in one place. If one of these tools does all you need, use it and support its author.
